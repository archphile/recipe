recipe - installation scripts and files needed for the Archphile distribution
======

## Note (2019-12-11)

These scripts and files need constant changes in order to be compliant with a rolling release distro like ArchlinuxARM.

In addition to the above, Archphile packages need rebuilding when the various libraries that these packages depend on get updated. 

I used to update/rebuild the packages before each release. I don't anymore. This means that if you use the scripts with my repos on it, your installation will fail 100%.
